# Full-Stack-Application
I used my company skin care products to set up my application. I thought that I could use my shop with Etsy, but I was never able to get approved to fetch my Data from my page. 
I set up my frontend up with wireframes. I set up my pages folders and my compoents folders added my codes for the Login, Enroll Form, and Nav Bar. I added images to my site as well for background. I ended up uploaded some of my pictures of my products to use my Products page.
I set up my routes and connected my pages. I set up a login page with email. On my Blog page you can search for different things on our site about skin care. I did not finish setting up my blog, wasted too much time on Etsy. I also did not finish setting up my cart.

On my backend I set up my CRUD Functionality. I did do my authenication. I set up my dependicies in Mongodb Data base set up my products page. 

I learned a lot on this journey which was definately a struggle. I cried so hard this morning I didnt know if I was going to be able to present my page but I pulled through. I will continue to work on this project because its so much I want to finish with this. Thank you so much for be a great insturtor.

I have my back and front end working, Prices and images with descriptions are showing up. I need to work on my cart and my blog. I also want to do a sign up page which I only have a login.
